                        a) In the wallet, go to the hamburger menu (top left) and then select Settings -> Researcher wizard. Choose Solo ("Beacon" may display as "Action Needed")

                            If your wallet doesn't look like the image above, press the "Start Over" button
                        </figcaption>
                        b) Press next and enter the email you used on your BOINC projects

                            Enter your email for your BOINC projects, and don't enter example@example.com
                        </figcaption> 
                        c) Click next and make sure you see a check mark (✔️) next to the field labeled CPID. <b>If you get a "split CPID or mismatched e-mail" error</b> or have any issues, proceed to the <a href="#cpid-troubleshooting">troubleshooting section</a>

                        d) Click next and then press the advertise beacon button. The beacon will cost less than 1 GRC to send. If you don't have 1 GRC, go to the previous step to see ways to acquire some for free. If you have GRC but receive an error about an insufficient balance, your GRC was received but you must wait a few minutes for the transaction to confirm, so try again in 15 minutes.

                        </figcaption>  
                        g) If you press next you should now see the screen below

                        h) Go to BOINC and click a whitelisted project you work on. Click on the Your Account button under Project web pages. If not listed, click on Home page and look for a setting or account options page on the website. <b>Note that the project you choose must be on the whitelist and not currently greylisted</b>. You can check if a project is actively whitelisted by going to menu > settings > researcher wizard and checking the projects tab.

                        i) If you see the page below, click on the other account info link. If you see something else, look for a place to change your username

                        j) Change your username temporarily to the code in your wallet until the beacon verifies (takes ~24-48 hours). This proves to the network that you own your account and are not trying to steal rewards from someone
                        <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/boinc-account-username-change.png" alt="image what the name change screen looks like with an example code filled in for the username">

                            Your BOINC project may look different. Don't use the exact code above. Use the code that was in your wallet
                        </figcaption>
                        Some projects require you to enable stats exports. If any of yours do, follow the steps for those project to enable it. If you skip this step, your beacon will not validate and you will not earn GRC for your BOINC crunching. Currently required by:
                            <ul class="text-center">
                                {%- for project in site.data.whitelist.projects -%}
                                {%- if project.gdpr == "yes" -%}
                                <li class="pt-0"><ul>{{project.name}} (<a href={{project.gdpr-enable-steps}}>steps to enable</a>)</ul></li>
                                {%- endif -%}
                                {%- endfor -%}
                            </ul>
                        k) After ~24-48 hours your beacon should validate and you should see something like the screen below. After you see this, you can now change your username to whatever you want

                        <div class="mb-5 pb-2">
                            <p class="text-center"><sup>See the <a href="/wiki/staking.html">staking wiki page</a> for more details on what staking is</sup></p>
                            l) <u>If you locked the wallet (not locked by default)</u>, unlock the wallet for "Staking Only". It is recommended to have it encrypted for security. 
                            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/wallet-unlock.png" alt="image showing the unlock menu that appears after press the unlock button. Shows 'for staking only' checked and a textbox to enter your password">

                            </figcaption>
                            m) Run the wallet close to 24/7. When your wallet is off, you miss chances to stake blocks and earn rewards. Make sure you see a filled in stack of squares in the bottom right like below
                            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/guide/wallet-staking.png" alt="image showing a filled in stack of squares being hovered over saying 'staking' and numbers about how likely it is to stake">
                            <figcaption class="text-center mb-4">
                                Your numbers will be different when you hover over the icon. Make sure the icon is lit and is not red or unlit. If it isn't, hover over it to see what issues are going on. Note that the "average" time to stake is an estimate, sometimes you may stake 5 times more often than "expected" and sometimes you may take 5x as long to stake as "expected".
                            </figcaption>
                            n) <u>Every 6 months</u>, your beacon will renew automatically if your wallet is open and unlocked for staking.

                            </figcaption>
                            o) Keep the wallet up to date as updates are released
                        </div>
<h5 class="text-center mt-5">4) Claiming Your Rewards</h5>
                  <div class="mb-5 pb-2">
                            <p>Your crunching will accrue rewards (shown as "pending reward" in wallet). This reward is based on a rolling average of your credit on BOINC projects called RAC (recent average credit), which means it will "ramp up" when you start crunching and "ramp down" when you stop. It will take approximately <i>two weeks</i> to reach your maximum average daily reward. There are two ways to claim your rewards: an MRC request or staking a block. </p>
                            <ol>
                              <li>You can make an MRC request at most every two weeks (you must wait two weeks for your first request). The longer you wait between requests, the lower the fee will be. The fee funds development and pays a staker to stake a block for you. To make a request, click the purple hand icon.</li>      
                              <li>You can stake a block. You will need approximately 6,000 GRC to stake <i>on average</i> once a month. Staking collects your rewards with no fees and you also collect fees from other transactions in the block you stake</li>
                            </ol>
                  </div>
<h5 class="text-center mt-5">5) Bonus Step: Sidestake to Help Gridcoin's Development</h5>
                        <div class="mb-5 pb-2">
                            <p>Gridcoin has a fun feature called <i>sidestaking</i> which enables you to donate a portion of each stake you make to Gridcoin's development. This isn't required of course, but it helps us add new features and make sure more people can learn about Gridcoin!</p>
                            <ol>
                              <li>Close your Gridcoin wallet</li>

                <h5 class="text-center">Q: My Wallet Is Not Staking</h5>
                    <li>Hover over the icon with the arrow to see why it is not staking</li>
                    <li>Check that the wallet is unlocked</li>
                    <li>Run the diagnostics under the help tab</li>
                    <li>If you see that your wallet is out of sync, try waiting a few hours leaving the wallet to sync</li>
                    <li>If the "verify clock" test has failed, check that your timezone on your computer is correct and that the time is also correct</li>
                    <li>If you see the ETTS (estimated time to stake) check has failed, consider either getting more coins or following the pool guide</li>
                  <li>Remember that the ETTS is an <i>average</i> time to stake. For example, if you average expected staking frequency is once per month, some months you may stake 5 times, and other times you may wait 5 months between a stake.</li>
                <h5 class="text-center mt-5">Q: My Balance is Too Low To Send a Beacon</h5>
                    <li>You need around 1 GRC to send a beacon. If you recently received some GRC, you will need to wait a few minutes for the transaction to be confirmed before using that GRC for a beacon.</li>
                    <li>You can use faucets to get free GRC for sending a Beacon: <a href="https://www.gridcoinstats.eu/faucet">Gridcoinstats.eu</a>, <a href="https://gridcoin.ch/faucet">Gridcoin.ch</a>. Our discord is a great place to ask for a few free GRC to get started</li>
                <h5 id="cpid-troubleshooting" class="text-center mt-5">Q: I See Multiple CPIDs or Receive a CPID Mismatch Error</h5>
                    <li>Make sure all your BOINC projects are attached <b>using the same e-mail address</b>. Remove any that aren't.</li>
                    <li>If you did components of both the pool and solo mining guide (you should only pick one), detach pool projects in BOINC go to Tools -> Stop using account manager and then manually remove any projects added by the pool</li>
                    <li>It can take some time for CPID's to "settle" onto one final CPID. You can hurry this process along using <a href="/wiki/faq.html#i-get-an-e-mail-mismatch-or-split-cpid-error-in-the-solo-crunching-wizard-in-the-wallet" target="_blank">these steps</a></li>
                    <li>After these steps, restart the crunching wizard in the wallet. If the problem persists, go to one of our support channels for help.</li>
                <h5 class="text-center mt-5">Q: My Beacon Isn't Being Verified</h5>
                    <li>Beacons typically take up to 24 hours to verify</li>
                    <li>Make sure you are crunching under your own account in BOINC and that the project is on the <a href="/guides/whitelist.htm">whitelist</a></li>. Make sure your project is not temporarily greylisted. In the wallet go to menu > settings > researcher wizard > projects and verify your project is listed there (greylisted projects do not appear).
                    <li>Make sure you changed your username</li>
                    <li>Check if your project is one that requires you to enable stats export

                            Try running the diagnostic (located under the help tab) and check that everything passes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make sure any projects you crunch are on the <a href="/guides/whitelist.htm">whitelist</a>. If it isn't on it, you will not be rewarded for it
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Check that the CPIDs (cross project identifier) are the same across your project 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If you found differing CPIDs, make sure you are using the same account. If you are on the same account, use <a href="https://steemit.com/gridcoin/@dutch/the-definitive-guide-to-fixing-a-split-cpid-gridcoin-s-and-boinc-s-1-problem">this guide</a> to help fix issues

                            If you just started crunching, you may need to wait around 24-48 hours for statistics to sync

                <h5 class="text-center anchor-adjust text-bold" id="non-gui">Configure the Wallet (non-GUI steps)</h5>
                <li>
                    I) Unlock your wallet fully if you've locked it
                </li>
                <li>
                    II) Run the command <code>advertisebeacon</code> and make note of the <code>verification_code</code>. If you lose track of the code, get it again with <code>beaconstatus</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    III) Login to one of your BOINC projects web pages and change your username to the verification code (you can change it back after your beacon validates)
                </li>
                <li>
                    IV) You can now lock your wallet again (you can unlock your wallet for staking too). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    V) Wait for your beacon to validate (check it with <code>beaconstatus</code>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    VI) Leave your wallet running and unlocked for staking as close as possible to 24/7. This will allow your wallet to stake and earn your rewards
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note: BOINC is needed on the machine running the wallet. It needs to be connected to any project on your account (it can be suspended)
                    If you setup BOINC in a non-default path, add it in the config (see <a href="../guides/gridcoin-install.htm">Step 2</a>)
